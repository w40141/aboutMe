A person who has a Dr Eng. degree but cannot make use of it at all.
I want to eat food from all over the world and live on a super public bath in the future.
I have been podcasting called "Zatudan 72%".
I Graduated from Doctoral Program in Department of Computer Science and Communications Engineering,
Waseda University, and I had been funded by
[JSPS Research Fellowship](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/index.html) (DC2 and PD). 
My research interests include hardware Security, side-channel attack,
quantum annealing, and Ising model transformation.
