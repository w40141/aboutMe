I am a Ph.D. student in
[Computer Science and Communications Engineering at Waseda University](https://www.fse.sci.waseda.ac.jp/en/)
and I had been funded by [JSPS Research Fellowship](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/index.html) (DC2). 
My research interests include hardware Security, side-channel attack,
quantum annealing, and Ising model transformation.
I'm currently job searching.
